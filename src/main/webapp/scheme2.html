        <h1>Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi</h1>
        <p>
            Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a central government initiative aimed at providing financial assistance to farmers in India. Under this scheme, eligible farmers receive ₹6,000 annually in three equal installments of ₹2,000 each. The goal is to supplement the financial needs of farmers for the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scheme is aimed at providing income support to small and marginal farmers, helping them meet their agricultural and household expenses. The funds are directly transferred to the bank accounts of farmers. This initiative plays a crucial role in improving the living standards of farmers, ensuring better food security, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scheme covers all farmers, except those who are in the income tax bracket or are recipients of certain other government benefits. To avail of the benefits, farmers need to register themselves and provide the necessary documents, such as Aadhaar, bank account details, and landholding information.
        </p>

        <p>
            The PM-KISAN scheme has become an important support mechanism for India's farmers, ensuring that they have financial stability and can continue to contribute to the country's agricultural economy.
