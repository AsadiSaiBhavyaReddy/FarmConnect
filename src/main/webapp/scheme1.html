        <h1>National Crop Insurance Scheme</h1>
        <p>
            The National Crop Insurance Scheme (NCIS) aims to provide financial support to farmers affected by natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The scheme helps protect farmers against losses and provides a safety net for their agricultural investments. Under this scheme, farmers are compensated for crop loss, which can occur due to a range of factors such as adverse weather conditions, pest attacks, or crop diseases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scheme offers affordable insurance coverage to farmers and helps stabilize their income, ensuring that they are not left vulnerable in times of crop failure. By participating in this scheme, farmers can ensure their livelihood and continue to contribute to the agricultural sector.
