        <h1>Organic Farming Promotion Scheme</h1>
        <p>
            The Organic Farming Promotion Scheme is a government initiative to encourage farmers to adopt organic farming practices. The objective of this scheme is to promote the cultivation of organic crops, enhance soil fertility, and reduce the dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, leading to healthier crops and a sustainable farming environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The scheme provides financial assistance to farmers to convert their traditional farming practices to organic farming. It supports various activities, including the certification of organic farms, the promotion of organic inputs, and the training of farmers in organic farming techniques. By adopting organic farming, farmers can access premium markets for their produce, improve soil health, and reduce the environmental impact of chemical farming practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            Key features of the scheme include:
            <ul>
                <li>Subsidies for organic inputs such as compost, bio-pesticides, and bio-fertilizers.</li>
                <li>Training and capacity building programs for farmers on organic farming practices.</li>
                <li>Financial assistance for organic certification and third-party inspections.</li>
                <li>Support for establishing organic farming clusters and value chains.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Organic Farming Promotion Scheme encourages farmers to shift toward sustainable agriculture and improve the quality of their produce, contributing to the overall environmental well-being of the country.
